        <p>It was my birthday. I got alot of gifts from my family. My dad came and gave me money and brought me cake. I ordered sushi but it wasn't that good and I didn't enjoy it. </p>

        <p>Around this time I started taking courses online. I was searching for something new to learn and found an online site that offers free online courses. I applied thinking that they will get to me in a while but they sent me an instant email that the moment I applied, they would give me a window of two months to both finish the course and take the exam. </p>
